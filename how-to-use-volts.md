# How to use volts

Once you've installed `volts` and added it to your project, you are ready to use it

> [See how to install volts here](install.md)

## Set up

1. Create a new script in Spark AR Studio \(`Add Asset + > Script > Typescript`\)
2. Then open your new script in your favorite code editor

> If you don't have a code editor, Spark AR and I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## Import volts into your scripts

You can selectively import parts of `volts` as follows

```typescript
import { Vector } from './volts';

// You can add or remove imports
// E.g.: import Vector AND World ðŸ‘‡
// import { Vector, World } from './volts';

// You can use Vector as follows:
const myVec = new Vector();
```
