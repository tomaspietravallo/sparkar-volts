```

### Download link

Use this \[\[link\]\] to download the latest version of the script as a traditional download

### Importing in Spark AR

Import the entire module

```ts
import VOLTS from "./sparkar-volts";
```

Use ES6 tree-shakable imports

```ts
import { Vector } from "./sparkar-volts";
``` -->

### Highlights

* Non-reactive: This framework takes an imperative approach, and tries to abstract away the SparkAR Reactive API as much as possible

* Typescript: You'll have a smoother and richer experience while developing. [Use VSC to take full advantage, with autocompletions and intellisense](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/scripting/scripting-basics/#scripting-fundamentals)

> Please make sure to read this list of reasons why you should prefer the ReactiveAPI over vanilla js: [Reactive programming, SparkAR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/scripting/reactive/), before using VOLTS, as it might not be the right thing for every project
