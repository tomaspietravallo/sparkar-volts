# Overview

sparkar-volts is an open source project which started as a continuation of [SparkAR-Math](https://github.com/tomaspietravallo/SparkAR-Math). This framework tries to work as an abstraction layer that simplifies a lot of the headaches that arise when programming imperative-style code in Spark AR.
